        <p>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Fuh Rae Jer, you can call me Ezzer. I have a passion for computers and coding. Delving into the intricate world of programming has always fascinated me, and I find joy in exploring the endless possibilities it offers. Outside the realm of coding, I'm an avid fan of Minecraft, where I immerse myself in its creative and adventurous gameplay.</p>
    <p>Currently, my focus is on coding a website known as ezzer.xyz, where I aim to showcase my skills and share valuable resources with fellow enthusiasts. At 13 years old, I'm eager to continue honing my coding abilities and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.</p>
    <p>If you're curious to see some of my earlier projects and creations, you can find me on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/frjer110811" target="_blank">Scratch</a> under the username frjer110811. I'm always excited to collaborate, learn, and grow within the coding community.</p>
    <p>Feel free to join me on my <a href="https://discord.gg/RWkbgkX82b" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>, where we can connect, share ideas, and embark on new coding adventures together.</p>
